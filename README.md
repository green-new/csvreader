# csvreader
A simple .csv file reader/writer capable of sorting and searching in C++

Has some issues with the sorting. Header information is often sorted, this can be avoided with records.begin() + 1 however. 
Hasn't been extensively stressed tested yet, hopefully I can find a use for it in the future personally.
